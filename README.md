# Green Fork Kitchen – MTM6201 Final Project
# mtm6201-final

## Overview
This website was created for the MTM6201 final assignment.  
It includes three pages — **Home**, **About**, and **Menu** — all built using **Bootstrap 5**, custom CSS, and responsive images.  
The goal was to create a clean, simple, and fully responsive vegetarian-themed website.

## Process
- Started by planning each page layout and choosing a consistent design theme.  
- Built the structure using **Bootstrap grid, navbar, and utilities**.  
- Customized the look using **CSS variables** and Google Fonts (Poppins).  
- Used **Animate.css** as the required additional CSS library.  
- Added semantic HTML and accessibility features (skip link, alt text, ARIA roles).  
- Optimized two images using `<picture>` and `srcset` for performance.  
- Tested layouts on mobile, tablet, and desktop to ensure responsiveness.


## Challenges & Solutions
- **Image alignment:** Fixed using Bootstrap columns and custom flexbox styling.  
- **Centering overlay text:** Solved using `position: absolute` with `transform`.  
- **Responsive images:** Learned and applied `<picture>` + `srcset` to serve different sizes.  


## What I Learned
- Better use of Bootstrap for layout and spacing  
- How to work with CSS variables  
- How to optimize images with `srcset`  
- How to improve accessibility using semantic tags & alt text  
- How to publish using GitHub Pages
